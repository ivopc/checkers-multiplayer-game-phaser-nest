# checkers-multiplayer-game-phaser-nest
Multiplayer Checkers game made with PhaserJS, NestJS, SocketIO (TypeScript).
We guys did this for a bet company here in Brazil, but we got scammed and did not get paid, so we decided to turn it open source.
It's incomplete in a lot of features for bet purpouses, but it's primary gameplay is working nice with some know bugs that you can check in repository's issues.
